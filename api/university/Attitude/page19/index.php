<h1>Relationships</h1>

<p>Successful people don’t go it alone. <br /><br />
They turn to others in times of adversity – positive people who build them up and keep them going. <br /><br />
Find people in whom you trust, people who always tell you the truth. <br /><br />
Put your faith in them, and ignore the rest. <br /><br />
Good relationships will help you stay positive and focused, so you can grow.
