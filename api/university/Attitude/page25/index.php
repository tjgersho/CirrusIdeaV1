<h1>Reinforcement</h1>

<p>Good attitudes, goals and values need constant reinforcement to stay that way.  <br /><br />
So form the habit of positive reinforcement.  <br /><br />
Read motivating books.  <br /><br />
See inspiring movies.  <br /><br />
Exercise.  <br /><br />
Pray.  <br /><br />
Spend time with those who boost you up.  <br /><br />
Whatever you can do to reinforce a positive attitude, do it regularly.
