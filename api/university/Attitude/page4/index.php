<p>Either you manage stress or it manages you.
Stress is inevitable. It’s the push and pull of daily life. Without it you might as well be dead.<br /><br />
But don’t let it kill you.<br />
Unmanaged stress can pull you down and affect your attitude.
There are lots of ways to manage stress: exercise, recreation, long walks, gardening, reading a good book -- these are just a few.
One of the best methods is to take positive action on the project or challenge that is causing your anxiety.
