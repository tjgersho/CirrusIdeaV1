<h1>Giving</h1>

<p>Live generously.<br /><br />
You’ll be happier for it; and you’ll make others happy as well.<br /><br />
In the Declaration of Independence, our forefathers wrote about our right to the “pursuit of happiness.”<br /><br />
The key word is “pursuit.”<br /><br />
Happiness itself is not a right or an entitlement.<br /><br />
Happiness comes from what you give.<br /><br />
So share yourself by giving, volunteering, and service. <br /><br />
<b>Live by the motto of the Rotary Club: “Service Above Self.”</b><br /><br />
