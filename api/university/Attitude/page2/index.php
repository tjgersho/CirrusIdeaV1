<p>Optimism is the result of a positive mental attitude.
Your personal and professional success and happiness are linked to your ability to develop a positive mental attitude.
What characterizes an optimist? Four behaviors that you learn through practice and repetition:
	<ul><li>Look for the good in every situation.</li>
	<li>Seek out the lesson in every setback.</li>
	<li>Look for the solution in every problem. </li>
	<li>Think and talk continually about your goals.</li>
	</ul><br />
<b>If you want to make friends, earn respect, win business, produce loyal clients, and enjoy the company of others, learn to be an optimist.</b>
