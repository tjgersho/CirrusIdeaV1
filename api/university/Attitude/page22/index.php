<h1>Discipline</h1>

<p>No matter how talented you are, you won’t get far without discipline. <br /><br />
Lack of discipline lets you get lazy and sets you adrift. <br /><br />
Pretty soon you find yourself going nowhere.  <br /><br />
You work less and fail to produce results. <br /><br />
You descend into depression and negativity. <br /><br />
It’s a downward spiral with no end in sight.<br /><br />
With a clear purpose and the discipline to work hard to achieve it, life becomes enjoyable.<br /><br />
Be your own task master. Avoid excuses and self-pity. <br /><br />
You’ll be happier for it.
