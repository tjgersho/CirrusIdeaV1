<h1>Awe</h1>

<p>Live life in awe. <br /><br />
What is awe? <br /><br />
It is a state of mind that marvels at the wonder of the universe. <br /><br />
Awe is ageless. <br /><br />
Awe is what the Buddhist calls <i>“beginner’s mind.”</i> <br /><br />
It is seeing everything as if for the first time – fresh, new, and wondrous. <br /><br />
With passion and enthusiasm, you can be 16 at 96. <br /><br />
Living in fear and distrust is what makes us old, not age.
