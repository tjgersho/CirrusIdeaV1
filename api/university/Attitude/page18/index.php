<h1>Simplicity</h1>

<p>We live in a complex world. <br /><br />
Knowledge and information is expanding exponentially. <br /><br />
So how do we keep up? <br /><br />
We donâ€™t. <br /><br />
Instead, seek the core of every situation. <br /><br />
Remember, life begins with two cells meeting and joining. <br /><br />
How simple is that? <br /><br />
There is immense power in simplicity.
