<h1>The Golden Rule</h1>

<p>We all know the Golden Rule. <br /><br />
It states that <b>you should treat others as you yourself would like to be treated.</b><br /><br />
Practicing the Golden Rule will help you lead a satisfying, happy life where things are likely to go your way.<br /><br />
Ignoring the Golden Rule will lead to an unhappy life devoid of meaning.<br /><br />
Other people, in all sorts of circumstances, deserve your tenderness, compassion and sympathy.<br /><br />
Just as you deserve theirs.<br /><br />
