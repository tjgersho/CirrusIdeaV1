<p>You have no doubt heard the phrase, an <i>“attitude of gratitude.”</i> <br /><br />
An attitude of gratitude is one of the keys to happiness.<br /><br />
No gratitude, no happiness, no matter how outwardly successful you appear. <br /><br />
Think about it: Have you every gone to bed hungry in your entire life? Millions if not billions of people around the world do so every night.<br /><br />
You have much to be grateful for.<br /><br />
Take Oprah Winfrey’s advice and keep a <i>“gratitude journal.” </i>
Count (and write) your blessings every day.
