<h1>Use It or Lose It</h1>

<p>Itâ€™s all too easy to lose sight of our priorities. <br /><br />
Life is full of distractions. <br /><br />
But when we have our purpose in mind, and constantly move toward it, we feel happy and peaceful. <br /><br />
The love of family and friends, along with faith, determines our real success in life. <br /><br />
Let love and faith guide you.
