<h1>Emotional Baggage</h1>

<p>You can’t see clearly or walk straight when you’re weighted down with emotional baggage.
People who make things happen for themselves and others are highly motivated, focused and positive.<br /><br/ >
Their minds are clear; their energy levels are high.<br /><br />
Emotional baggage – emotions like anger and resentment – is akin to cancer. Left untreated, it will eat away at your dreams and put a ceiling on your future.<br /><br/ >
Learn to forgive and forget.
