<h1>Smile While You Talk</h1>

<p>A smile is a lamp that illuminates the soul.<br /><br />
It says happy, open, confident -- without saying a word.<br /><br />
It’s warmth from the inside out.<br /><br />
A smile lets others know you’re home, welcoming them to visit.<br /><br />
If you don’t know a word of another’s language, smile.<br /><br />
It’s the universal symbol of a positive attitude.<br /><br />
Your smile may touch someone in ways you’ll never know.<br /><br />
In a group full of strangers, be the first to smile. <br /><br />
