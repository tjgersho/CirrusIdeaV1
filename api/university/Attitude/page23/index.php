<h1>Find A Mentor /Be A Mentor</h1>

<p>Most successful people didn’t become that way entirely on their own. <br /><br />
They had mentors. <br /><br />
Mentors are guides who can help you stay focused and positive. <br /><br />
They can boost your self-confidence and help you reach your full potential. <br /><br />
Mentors can be flesh and blood people, or historical figures you admire. <br /><br />
Either way, learn what they have to teach you – spiritually, mentally and emotionally. <br /><br />
