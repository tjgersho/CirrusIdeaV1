<h1>Choice</h1>

<p>It’s not so much what happens to you in life that matters – it’s how you choose to react to it.  <br /><br />
There’s always an excuse for not accomplishing something we want to do.  <br /><br />
There’s always an obstacle of some kind standing in our way.  <br /><br />
Successful people don’t let excuses or obstacles stop them.  <br /><br />
They choose to go forward regardless of circumstances.  <br /><br />
Whenever you encounter a setback, remember you have a choice.  <br /><br />
