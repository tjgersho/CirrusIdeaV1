<h1>Health</h1>

<p>Imagine yourself wealthy – and sick. <br /><br />
What good is wealth, without health? <br /><br />
Imagine yourself healthy – and poor. <br /><br />
From where would you rather start? <br /><br />
Health is the only true form of wealth. <br /><br />
So be healthy!  <br /><br />
Start with exercise.  <br /><br />
Our bodies are meant to move. <br /><br />
The more you move, the higher your energy threshold. <br /><br />
That means that, at the end of the day, you have energy to spare. <br /><br />
You also sleep better. <br /><br />
Sleep heals and restores your body and mind. <br /><br />
Give yourself seven to nine hours a night. <br /><br />
It’s like money in your body/mind bank. <br /><br />
And the biggest investment of all? – nutritious food. <br /><br />
Don’t pour sugar in your gas tank. <br /><br />
Avoid the “whites” – white flour, rice, potatoes. <br /><br />
Go for color – carrots, beets, broccoli, greens. <br /><br />
Use your imagination to create meals your body and mind will love. <br /><br />
