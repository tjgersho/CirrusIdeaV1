<h1>Laugh</h1>

<p>Laughter is smiling out loud.<br /><br />
It’s a burst of positive energy that won’t stay contained.<br /><br />
Laughter is scientifically proven to alter brain chemistry, to release endorphins, which are like little warriors that boost your immune system and fight off illness.<br /><br />
Find reasons to laugh.<br /><br />
After all, life is not all that serious.  <br /><br />
A good burst of laughter is like a jolt of positive energy.  <br /><br />
