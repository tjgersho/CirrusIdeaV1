<h1>Saying No</h1>

<p>The biggest time-saver in the world is the little word “no.”  <br /><br />
Of course, we would all rather say “yes.”  <br /><br />
Yes is more polite.  <br /><br />
It makes us feel good to say yes to others.  <br /><br />
But too many yeses can make a mess of our lives.  <br /><br />
We simply don’t have enough time and energy to say yes to everyone and everything.  <br /><br />
When we do, we inevitably disappoint others and ourselves.  <br /><br />
Learn to say no, but graciously.  <br /><br />
Feel honored that you were asked, and let the other person know.
 <br /><br />
