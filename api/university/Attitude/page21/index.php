<h1>Journaling</h1>

<p>When you are stuck and don’t know what else to do, start writing.  <br /><br />
It’s the best way out of a slump.  <br /><br /> 
Capture your thoughts without editing.  <br /><br />
Write to God if you’d like.  <br /><br />
Celebrate your wins. Spill your frustrations. Put down your goals. Capture ideas.  <br /><br />
Writing is a great release.  <br /><br />
Seeing everything on paper will give you energy and lift your spirits.  <br /><br />
And don’t forget to write to others.  <br /><br />
In our electronic world, a hand-written note of thanks, encouragement, sympathy or friendship stands out like a gift.
