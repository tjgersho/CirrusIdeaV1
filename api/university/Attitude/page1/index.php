<p><b>What is attitude?</b></p>
<p>It’s the way you look at life. 
If you want to change your life, change your attitude.
You can always spot people with a good attitude – they light up the room.
Bad attitudes empty rooms, ruin people, and sabotage organizations.
With a poor attitude, you can only go so far.
With a great attitude, the sky’s the limit.</p>
<br />
<p><b>How do you develop a great attitude?</b></p>
<p>Think about what you think about.
Good thoughts? Bad thoughts?
It’s a universal, life-changing law: You become what you think about.
Once you understand this law, you can harness the power of a positive mental attitude. </p>
<br />
<p><b>How do you become and stay positive?</b></p>
<p>Surround yourself with positive people.
Don’t hang with people who find fault in everything, including you.
Fly with those who lift you and others up.
Imagine a football stadium full of cheering fans, cheering for you.
That’s the power of positivity.

“The greatest discovery of this generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes of mind.” – William James, 19th century psychologist</p>
