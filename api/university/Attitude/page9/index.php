<h1>Knowing Thyself</h1>


<p>A living is not a life.<br /><br />
To have a life worth living, find and pursue your passion.<br /><br />
Begin by dreaming. <br /><br />
There is no one else in the world quite like you.<br /><br />
Your challenge is to discover who you are, your unique gifts and talents.<br /><br />
Then you can match those gifts and talents with a career that’s meant for you.<br /><br />
How do you go about it?<br /><br />
	Make a list of all your gifts, your strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />
	Think about what motivates you, what gets you fired up and excited in life, and list those things as well.<br /><br />

<br /><br /> <b>Be patient and persist. Your life’s purpose may not reveal itself to you right away. But when it does, it will lead to a positive mental attitude so powerful that nothing can stand in the way of your goals.</b><br /><br />
