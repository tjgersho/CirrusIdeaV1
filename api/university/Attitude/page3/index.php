<h1>Worry</h1>
<div class="row">

<p>The more you dwell on feelings of anxiety, the more anxious you feel.
Worry saps efficiency. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, who wrote “The Power of Positive Thinking,” stated that the average worrier is 92% inefficient. 
Only 8% of what we worry about ever comes to pass.
So why waste time and energy worrying about something that will likely never happen?
Feed your faith and starve your fear.
